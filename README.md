## About the Application

This makeup e-commerce site lands users on the homepage where the user can view some featured vegan makeup products that are under $10 as well as the user can view other pages for more information on the site. Users may go to the catalogue to view the different products that are split up into three sections giving users an easier way to find what they're looking for.

The user at any point may search for a type of product in the search area that is found in the top navagation bar of the screen at all times. If nothing is entered in the search bar it will display all products, and if a query is inputted with no matching results, an error will display on the screen.

If the user would like to see more information about a product they may click on the product itself which will load a page with more information on it such as the description and rating. Users may also view reviews of each product and they can also post a review themselves.
